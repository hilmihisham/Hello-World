Hello, humans!

I've read somewhere that GitHub is a useful thing to have while I'm out there looking for a job somewhere in the future.. All those job hunting realm still seems a bit far from me really, but come the end of next year, I'll be graduating (hopefully, pray for me) and for sure it's gonna hit me - hard. 

So I think it's better to prepare from now and have something to help ease out the impact a bit, no?

I'm still learning the rope to programming at this moment. Java is the only language I have so far (that I can at least code something straight off from my heart) with a little bit of C which I've learn the basics of it in one class last semester. I do have several apps idea that I wanna make, but I've been busy with school trying to grad on time and I've still got a long way to go, lot more stuff to learn before all those ideas can be materialized.. Hopefully with the creation of my GitHub page, I can be one step closer to that!

With that, I'm finishing my first edit of my first repo here in this GitHub..

Looking forward to see where I'll ended up 5 or 10 years for now.. Hopefully into something great!
